# SQL Problem â€“ Find Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

## Problem Statement  
We are given a table **Views** with the following structure:

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| article_id  | int  |
| author_id   | int  |
| viewer_id   | int  |
| view_date   | date |

- Each row indicates that a `viewer_id` viewed an article written by `author_id` on a given date.  
- If `author_id = viewer_id`, it means the author has viewed **their own article**.  
- The task is to **find all authors who viewed at least one of their own articles**.  
- The result must be sorted by `id` in ascending order.
